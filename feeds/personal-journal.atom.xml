My over-thinking, hypersensitive mind constantly creates obstacles for me, over-complicating things that should remain
simple. So here I am, trying to let go of all the artificial complexities, and to just start writing something, anything,
to get things going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-expectations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this site, my main expecation is to provide a general framework for me to explore different projects, ideas and experiences.
I long for adventures, growth, wild creations, deep study and musing. But there are so many things I want to do that I almost
always overwhelm myself with many different strong yet fickle urges that tear me down instead of building me up. With
this site, I hope to learn to explore in a more directed manner. In the forms of projects and blogs which have an definite
finish to each unit, I can at least accomplish some well-defined goals that lead to a bigger narrative, instead of wandering
aimlessly in a space of infinite possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site will also serve as an almost-journal to document my journey. For a long time I have this fear of being forgotten,
not just by others, but also by myself. I want to create something that I can hold onto, that proves my existence, a
mini-immortality project if you may.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have an urge to express myself. I have so many loose ideas that constantly show up and disappear, all in a blur.
With no one in real life to explore them with, I have to resort to writing to re-discover, re-define and preserve these thoughts.
Otherwise, I fear I lose this general ability to capture and communicate my thoughts faithfully; I fear I lose access to my truest
self and potentials because of my devolving languages due to lack of deep socialisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hr-projects"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;40/50-hr Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decide to experiment with this approach. It involves spending no more than 40 hours on a small project, and document it
here. Each project comes with an extra 5 hour of planning and 5 hour of documenting (blogging), so it's really a 50-hour project.
The 40 hours are the time I should be fully focusing on &lt;strong&gt;doing&lt;/strong&gt; the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already see myself having many doubts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 hours? That's too short a time for me to develop any expertise! A: The goal is never to develop any &amp;quot;expertise&amp;quot; in a field
in just a short period. The goal is to learn to focus on the work itself, to experience it and study it deeply within
a time and resource constraint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I just rush to the deadline without focusing on the quality of the project itself or even the knowledge I could've gained?
A: This would exercise my project planning and management abilities. With such a short period, I need to learn to set realistic
goals and curb any unproductive distorters of reality: massive ego, grandiose ideas, etc, and to learn to plan time wisely
so that every hour counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this mean I can only limit myself to small and trivial projects?
A: No. If I am truly absorbed in a grand project, I can learn to split it up into 40-hr projects. The pattern I need to
get out of is to head first into a big project, get overwhelmed, quit and repeat. Maybe in the future when I master this
approach, I can learn to extend the period to start incorporating projects that really require uninterrupted long periods of
time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blogs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also aim to publish to this site at least once every 2 weeks. The content may be technical or non-technical, and they
may coincide with the project blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
