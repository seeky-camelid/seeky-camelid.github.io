title: Body, emotions, consciousness and intelligence (1)
description: Notes of the book The Feeling of What Happens, by Antonio Damasio
---

I started reading a book recommended by my therapist, The Feeling of What Happens - body, emotion and
the making of consciousness by Antonio Damasio.

It is not too difficult a read but it is quite dense; I'v only just finished the first chapter, after much procrastination
and little progress over the past couple weeks. However I can already tell this will be an interesting read.

The book tries to explore the neurobiology of consciousness. So far I can see it is trying to make a central claim that emotions
and the body are a big and necessary part of consciousness, as the title of the book also quite evidently suggests.

It first lists the two quintessential problems of neurobiology of consciousness (p11):
* How the movie-in-the-brain mental images of objects are generated.
* How the brain also generates the sense that there is an owner and observer for that movie.

The author also suggests that the two big problems are intimately related and nested within each other.
I find it also interesting that the author speculates solving the first problem requires addressing a famous philosophical
problem, the hard problem of [qualia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/). He believes that the
qualia problem can be eventually explained neurobiologically but admits that currently there is an explanatory gap. 
(So the author is a reductionist? Well I guess this is a given, since any purely neurobiological account of consciousness
is automatically reductionist).

My interest, coming from the background of AI, lies in the relationship between consciousness and intelligence. The author seems to
suggest that intelligence is not a necessary condition for consciousness, but then what about the reverse? Would general intelligence
require consciousness as a necessary condition?
