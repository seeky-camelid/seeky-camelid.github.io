## Add both last modified and published dates
Taking inspirations from this answer: https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/869#issuecomment-767986086

With some help from MS copilot, I installed the child_process npm package, to use git in a shell command to get the last commit and first commit date.

I also decided to use a filter instead of shortcode, for easier chaining with further filters.

## Use h2 (second-rank heading) for headings inside an article

Inside an article /post, use "## heading" instead of "# heading" as the top level headings. This is because:
1. h1 is used for the title of the article
2. For some compatibility reasons, h1 and h2 look exactly the same inside the <article> selector. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51321157)
