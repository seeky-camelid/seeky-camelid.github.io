      <article class="paragraph text-lg"><p>I started reading a book recommended by my therapist, The Feeling of What Happens - body, emotion and
the making of consciousness by Antonio Damasio.</p>
<p>It is not too difficult a read but it is quite dense; I'v only just finished the first chapter, after much procrastination
and little progress over the past couple weeks. However I can already tell this will be an interesting read.</p>
<p>The book tries to explore the neurobiology of consciousness. So far I can see it is trying to make a central claim that emotions
and the body are a big and necessary part of consciousness, as the title of the book also quite evidently suggests.</p>
<p>It first lists the two quintessential problems of neurobiology of consciousness (p11):</p>
<ul>
<li>How the movie-in-the-brain mental images of objects are generated.</li>
<li>How the brain also generates the sense that there is an owner and observer for that movie.</li>
</ul>
<p>The author also suggests that the two big problems are intimately related and nested within each other.
I find it also interesting that the author speculates solving the first problem requires addressing a famous philosophical
problem, the hard problem of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/">qualia</a>. He believes that the
qualia problem can be eventually explained neurobiologically but admits that currently there is an explanatory gap.
(So the author is a reductionist? Well I guess this is a given, since any purely neurobiological account of consciousness
is automatically reductionist).</p>
<p>My interest, coming from the background of AI, lies in the relationship between consciousness and intelligence. The author seems to
suggest that intelligence is not a necessary condition for consciousness, but then what about the reverse? Would general intelligence
require consciousness as a necessary condition?</p>
