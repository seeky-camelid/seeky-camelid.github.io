      <article class="paragraph text-lg"><p>Half reflecting, half predicting, mainly targeted at my ideal embodied agent vs the current mainstream foundation models.</p>
<p>I think training / retraining a model offline on curated datasets then deploying it statically will be a thing of the past, at least for embodied agents that are meant to interact with the real world.</p>
<h1>The real world dynamics are not stationary</h1>
<p>This lemma basically rules out the &quot;train once, deploy indefinitely&quot; methodology (or the zero-shot &quot;learning&quot; with methods like prompt engineering) as viable for embodied A(G)I. For a finite model in an unpredictably non-stationary world, real learning (i.e. the adjustment of the model's dynamics) needs to occur.</p>
<p>For neural network models, this means an embodied AI will always need downstream retraining for it to be practical in non-trivial use cases, no matter how powerful and comprehensive the underlying foundation model is.</p>
<p>Therefore, just like how a healthy and functional human intelligence needs lifelong adaptation and learning (Neuroplasticity), I'd argue that a functional embodied AI would also need to acquire this much more flexible and superior method: lifelong online learning from &quot;lived&quot; experiences.</p>
<h1>The real world dynamics are not unitary</h1>
<p>This is one of my other gripes with the current status of large foundation models. They assumes a single, unified, almost omnipresent locus of human knowledge. Or rather, it eliminates any individual perspective of the world. This is why it is so hard / impossible for a foundation model to take a real stance on any particular problem.</p>
<p>However, an embodied agent inherently requires a position and a perspective in the world; it inherently needs an &quot;I&quot; to function. This cannot be handed down by the foundation models; it can only be learned throughout the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the agent.</p>
